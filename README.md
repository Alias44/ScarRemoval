# Scar Removal
Syrchalis has stepped away from the RimWorld modding scene, as such I am adopting the mod and will be maintaining it going forward.

Allows removing of scars, healing of ailments and regrowing of tiny body parts for glitterworld medicine

## Main Features
This mod allows the fixing of scars and regrowing of small body parts with glitterworld medicine and gives alternatives to Luciferum and Healer Mech Serum for health conditions that cannot be fixed otherwise.

## Summary
Brain scars need additional materials since they have a much greater effect on pawns. Small body parts include:
[*]Fingers
[*]Toes
[*]Ears
[*]Noses
[*]Tails (for alien pawns that use vanilla tail BodypartDef)

It gives alternative ways to fix the issues that can usually only be fixed with Luciferum or a Healer Mech Serum. Health issues like "Bad Back" or "Asthma" can be fixed by replacing the corresponding part and thus are not included.
- Alzheimers
- Dementia
- Frail

## Compatibility
Safe to add to existing game saves. Like most mods, remove at your own risk.

Incompatibilities & Interactions:
Pharmacist - make sure to enable glitterworld meds for surgeries or it will say (need material)
Rah's Bionics and Surgery Expansion - This mod will remote the RBSE scar removal recipes and slot in it's own (gated behind the appropriate research)

## License
The Original mod is unlicensed, but given this comment from the author:
> I use the MIT license for everything

(and that attempts to contact the author have met no response) I am going to operate on the assumption that the mod was intended to be MIT licensed. As such, I am attaching a LICENSE file in my name to cover any changes made to the mod since forking.
